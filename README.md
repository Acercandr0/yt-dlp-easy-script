### Simple YouTube Video Downloader for Windows

This is a super simple Windows script that handles the entire download process for you. Just save it as a **.bat** file and run it whenever you want to download a video.

**How it Works:**

* **Checks for dependencies:** It first verifies if **Python** and **yt-dlp** are installed on your system. If they aren't, it automatically installs them.
* **Downloads the video:** It prompts you to paste the URL of the video you want to download.
* **High-quality conversion:** The script downloads the video and converts it to an **MP4** in the best possible quality.
* **Saves to downloads:** The final video is saved directly to your default **Downloads** folder.

This makes downloading YouTube videos quick and easy, with no need to know anything about the command line or Python.
